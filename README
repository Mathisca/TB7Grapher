# TB7 Plotter

A program to visualize the plotter of mathematical functions passed in by the user. It consists in four parts : *Lexical Analyser* , *Syntaxical Analyser*, *Code Interpreter* and *Grapher*.

## Getting Started

Open the project in your favorite EDI equipped with the SDL libraries and simply run it as it is.

### Prerequisites

The SDL2, SDL2-Image and SDL2-ttf libraries are needed to execute the program.

To stop at any time the test running, click on the close button (located top right).

### And coding style tests

Use breakpoints and the debugger options in order to test the code. 
Functions in 'test.c' may help you testing each part of the code.
